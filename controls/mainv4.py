#This code collects data from the OD, pH, and temperature sensor. The command "OD" is sent through the serial port, which is read by the arduino. The arduino code
#turns on the pumps and valves and also samples and send back pH data to the python code. The python code manages the tinkerforge interface and uses that to control the color bricks
# and temp sensor
